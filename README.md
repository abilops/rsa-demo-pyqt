# rsa-demo-pyqt
A small Qt graphical application that demonstrates calculations performed in the RSA cryptosystem

# What does it do?
It is a cute application that performs the humongous calculations that are involved in the implementation of RSA.

**It is not an identical implementation of the actual RSA algorithm, just a gross simplification**

This is a great way to learn about RSA.

# Great! How do I make it do that?
### For macOS or Linux

Well, download this code with `git clone https://github.com/abilops/rsa-demo-pyqt` and run `python3 rsa.py`.
You'll probably need `PyQt5`. No problem, just run `pip3 install pyqt5` or `python3 -m pip install pyqt5`.

### For Windows

I know for a fact that this runs on Windows, but you're on your own to figure out how. (Try [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16846501/how-to-install-pyqt5-on-windows 
"A StackOverflow question. I did half the work for you. Now go follow those instructions"))
